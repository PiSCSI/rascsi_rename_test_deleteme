= What is PiSCSI (formerly RaSCSI Reloaded) =
{|
|PiSCSI is a virtual [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI SCSI] device emulator that runs on a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi Raspberry Pi]. It is a two piece solution, with a hardware and software component. PiSCSI can emulate multiple SCSI devices concurrently, provides a control interface to attach / detach drives, as well as insert and eject removable media. Simply connect the PiSCSI interface board to your system, launch the PiSCSI software on the Raspberry Pi, and the virtual devices will be accessible as physical SCSI devices!

|PiSCSI is a re-branding of the "RaSCSI Reloaded" project. There are a LOT of updates that need to be made to the documentation and this will take time. Please have patience as we work through the rebranding. There are a lot of new features as well as a new logo coming soon

__TOC__

= Introduction and history =
PiSCSI was originally developed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20220520151335/http://retropc.net/gimons/rascsi/ by GIMONS] for use with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000 Sharp X68000].

The purpose of this repository is to take the awesome work by GIMONS and build upon it, using the open source community. This project was forked from version 1.47 of GIMONS' RaSCSI project. Over time, this project has had significant updates and architectural changes, providing unique capabilities beyond the original PiSCSI project.

PiSCSI has been demonstrated on dozens of retro computing platforms and digital samplers. A [https://github.com/piscsi/piscsi/wiki/Compatibility compatibility list] is available showing which platforms have been tested. Additional testing is appreciated, along with updating the system comparability table with your findings.

= Raspberry Pi and System compatibility = 

With many people working on and testing PiSCSI on their own systems, you can find details on what Raspberry Pis and which computers work together. Check out the [https://github.com/piscsi/piscsi/wiki/Compatibility Compatibility] page.

= Benchmarks =
Benchmark testing has been performed with the PiSCSI on a few different Raspberry Pi models. Please check the [https://github.com/piscsi/piscsi/wiki/Benchmarks benchmarks] page for additional details.

-----

= Hardware Component =
== Connection Method ==
The hardware component of PiSCSI interfaces with GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to read/control the SCSI signals. As the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins operate at 3.3v and SCSI signalling is 5v, the PiSCSI interface uses bus transceivers allowing the Raspberry Pi to safely communicate on the SCSI bus. The SCSI I/O signal is used to control the direction of the Data signals, and a dedicated GPIO pin is used to control the direction of several control signals. As of Sept 2020, the suggested transceiver is the SN74LS641-1 from Texas Instruments. As development is still underway, a [[Transceiver-Comparison|comparison of different transceivers]] has been compiled.

== Assembling your own ==
For those who have purchased the DIY kit on [https://www.tindie.com/products/landogriffin/rascsi-macintosh-version/ Tindie], or have procured your own PCBs and components, check the [[Full Size PiSCSI Assembly|full size]] or [[PiSCSI Zero Assembly|Zero]] assembly page for instructions on building your own PiSCSI board. 

== Alternate Connection Method ==
Some people have reported successfully connecting the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins directly to a SCSI interface. This may work, but runs the Raspberry Pi GPIO beyond the specifications, and ''is not recommended''.

== Expansion options ==
The PiSCSI board has had an additional header installed exposing the I2C bus. With this you can install additional features like an OLED display. Read more on how to [[OLED Status Display (Optional)|connect an OLED display]] or a [[PiSCSI-Control-Board|Control Board]] to the PiSCSI.

-----

= Software Component =
== Downloading and installing the software ==
Once you have PiSCSI board, instructions on how to setup your Raspberry Pi, and downloading and installing the PiSCSI software can be found on the [[Setup Instructions]] page.

== Connecting PiSCSI to your computer ==
Now that you have the PiSCSI board connected to your Raspberry Pi, and have the software downloaded and installed, next is to connect the PiSCSI device to your computer. Details on SCSI devices, termination and cabling can be found on the [[Connecting the PiSCSI]] page.

== I have the software and everything connected, what next? ==
With the PiSCSI board attached to your computer, and PiSCSI downloaded and installed, instructions on creating and attaching disk images can be found on the [[Drive Setup]] page.

Additionally, a web interface can be used to attach and detach images, manage the images, and the Raspberry Pi itself. More details on the web interface and how to set it up can be found on the [[Web Interface]] page.
